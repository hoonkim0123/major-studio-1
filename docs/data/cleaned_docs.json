I informed you that I had the horse Harry bought for me taken from me at Rye, and indorsed to you the proceedings of the justice, you will doubtless observe sir that the authority is in the name of His Majesty. I was in the Town of Rye, and had I refused to take the justice under that sanction I might go without it, but the horse I should not have. I have now enclosed my deposition that the horse taken from me is the same that Harry purchased for me in Philadelphia. I beg you to excuse the trouble I give you sir in desiring you to give the deposition to M Wintton or to W Banell, which of them is kind enough to look into this matter for me. I shall make all possible despatch for Boston and shall immediately attend to your commands. William Bant, Esq.",

    "year": 1808,
    "description": "This is a three-page folio ALS to the General Post Office in Washington, D.C. regarding the continuation of the postal route in case of war at a future period. Written from Coopers Ferry, Gloucester County, New Jersey, on 28 January 1808, this is \"a copy of a letter sent to General Post Office, Washington City.\" Signed R. M. C.,\" likely Robert M. Cooper who replaced Postmaster Charles Cooper (1806-1810) at Cooper's Ferry in 1810. The Post Office name at Cooper's Ferry changed to Camden, NJ, on June 22, 1829. Respected Friend I received thine of the 14 Inst and note the [?] As there has been some change in the post office in one of the Eggharbor Townships, [?] dropping the post office at Baegain[?] Town and establishing one at Abssom, at the latter place there has yet been but little business done. The mail carrier informs me that there is scarcely a letter mailed there or one left for delivery but little as it is, it was the duty of the P.M. to have forwarded his accounts, etc. Joseph Sharp Esq. is the post master at that office but the business is done by a Deputy. William Erwin is the post master at Weymouth Post Office which is on the route, a person fully competent for the office and I apprehend has forwarded his accounts before this will reach Washington. John Donalds of Longacoming I heard was appointed P.Master at that place some time since, but I have understood he declines accepting the appointment and the letter directed for Look-a-coming[?] are taken out of the mail at the post office at Haddorfield; of course it is considered that there is no post office at Lonacoming[?]. I cannot account for the reason that Joseph Reynolds P.M. at Haddorfield[?] has not forwarded his account for I believe he is at home and in health. There is I apprehend some misconception in regard to the information obtained respecting there being no return receive[?] at Washington from the Post Office at Coopers Ferry [begin page 2] at the date of my letter. The accounts current and account of mails received at and sent from that office were forwarded by mail the 5th Inst for the quarter ending 31st ultimo and at the same time a request was made for a supply of Blank Way Bill and other Blank, which have in consequence been received from Washington at the Post Office at Coopers Ferry some days before the receipt of thy favour, so that there can be no doubt of the receipt of the account, etc. from this place at Washington some time before the 14th Inst. the date of thy letter and there is receipts now in the office for every quarter preceding the last, since the establishment of the office at this place. In respect to information with regard to the route of the mail from this place to the Egghorbour Townships I apprehend it will not shortly be a profitable one for the United States, as the daily and almost hourly private conveyances which offer from Philadelphia to those townships and which affords so many opportunities to convey letters without charge, and the scattered situation of the inhabitants, all combine to make private conveyance of letters more common than by mail. The Stage Driver who is the mail carrier, although he has the hundred dollar more for carrying the mail, to those townships than is paid for carrying the Tuckulos[?] mail, which is about the same distance from this place, informed me he finds it but a poor business on account of the frequent intercourse by private waggons, which carry packages at a fare very much under his price [begin page 3] which deprives him very considerably of one of the [?] of making it worth his while to continue the business after the expiration of his contract. I think this will continue to be the case while the inhabitants of that quarter follow their present pursuits of taking fish, [?], etc. for the Philadelphia market which continually keeps their wagon passing and repassing on the same route as the mail. Nevertheless as there is a port of entry at Townes[?] Point in Egghorbour Township, it will perhaps be to the interest of the United States to continue the route, more especially in case of a rupture with any naval power what ever, as it is in the recollection of many persons, that during the last war, Eggharbour was the way by which considerable quantities of merchandize were brought to Philadelphia by land, which no doubt will be the case again if a war should take place at a future period. I am respectfully Thy Friend R. M. C[?] P. S. Since closing the above I have seen J. Donalds from Longacoming who informed me that if no other person was appointed PM at that place before next spring he would then accept of the appointment but could not at this time take it on acount of his frequent absence from home.

    "description": "The 18-page volume appears to have been rebound; no date is given for the binding, but Bound by Zaehnsdorf, London, England\" appears in gilt on the inside the red, Moroccan leather, front cover and the title, United States Post-Office 1792\" runs down the spine. Portions of the handwritten marginalia were trimmed away to make a new clean edge for this volume that contains various postal documents from 1792, including: An Act of Establish the Post Office and Post Roads within the United States,\" Instructions to the Deputy Postmasters,\" a rate chart commencing June 1792, and a quarterly report from the New Haven, Connecticut, post office for April 1 to July 1, 1792. The image here shows the Instructions to the Deputy Postmasters on the right and the last page of the Post Office Act of 1792 on the left. The Post Office Act of 1792 was the most important single piece of postal legislation enacted in the early republic. On three occasions between 1789 and 1792, Congress passed temporary measures to maintain the postal system. During that time, Congress debated the regulation of the system established by Article 1, section 8 of the federal Constitution, which states: The Congress shall have the Power . . . To Establish Post Offices and post Roads.\" Among the issues that Congress debated were rate structure, privacy, and procedures for the establishment of new postal routes. The Post Office Act of 1792 codified the presumption that Congress would retain primary control over postal policy--a presumption that remained a cornerstone of that policy until the service was restructured under the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. In particular, the Post Office Act of 1792 admitted newspapers into the mail at extremely low rates, facilitating the spread of information essential to the creation of an informed citizenry. The Act also forbade the opening of letters as a tool of surveillance. In addition, it established the principle that new post routes would be designated by Congress--rather than the executive - forestalling the possibility that narrow financial considerations might constrain the network's expansion.

    "title": "William Goddard's petition to the Continental Congress",
    "year": 1774,
    "description": "On this single-sheet manuscript signed by William Goddard, he addressed a petition to the Continental Congress for the establishment of a postal system that would compete with the colonial British Post Office and included an addendum paragraph initialed W.G.,\" dated September 29, 1774, and location given as Philadelphia. William Goddard was one of several publishers who used private carriers to get their news past the prying eyes of the Crown's post office. Goddard experienced the abuse of authority by the British firsthand in Philadelphia after he formed a partnership with Benjamin Franklin to publish the Pennsylvania Chronicle, a paper sympathetic to the revolutionary cause. The local postmaster failed to deliver out-of-town newspapers to Goddard, depriving him of a critical source of information. The Chronicle was subsequently driven out of business when the Crown post refused to accept it in the mails. Goddard retaliated by designing a distinctly American postal system to challenge the Crown's post office. He founded the proposal on the principles of open communication, freedom from governmental interference, and the guaranteed free exchange of ideas. Goddard presented his plan to the Continental Congress on October 5, 1774, nearly two years before the formal declaration of independence from England. Congress tabled Goddard's plan until after the battles of Lexington and Concord in the spring of 1775. On July 26, 1775, the plan, known as the 'Constitutional Post', was adopted and implemented, ensuring communication between patriots and keeping the general populace informed of events during the American Revolution. Goddard’s system provided a link between members of the Committees of Correspondence, Committees of Safety, and the Sons of Liberty. Goddard also achieved a measure of personal revenge as the revolutionary post forced the Crown's post office out of business in America on Christmas Day 1775. The Constitutional Post became the foundation of the United States' postal system.",

He presented his proposal to the Constitutional Congress nearly seven months after this publication. On July 26, 1775, the Congress adopted and implemented the plan, now known as the 'Constitutional Post'.

When the methodically-minded Benjamin Franklin became joint deputy postmaster general in North America, he promptly instituted a new system of accounts, including one that enabled the General Post Office to standardize local postmasters' accounting methods. The new manner of bookkeeping did not abolish the opportunity for the dishonest to profit but it did prove beneficial since the comptroller could now check a new postmaster's accounts against the old for losses.",

Although disappointed by some aspects of Jay’s final agreement, Hamilton successfully crusaded for Senate ratification. Monroe’s failure to reassure France’s revolutionary government about Jay’s treaty got him recalled from his post in 1796. Monroe blamed the fiasco on Hamilton, and exposed Hamilton’s extramarital affair with Maria Reynolds in revenge. The two nearly dueled over the scandal in 1797.",

    "title": "Letter to Mary Seward from John Seward",
    "year": 1776,
    "description": "John Seward sent this letter, dated March 29, 1776, to his wife Mary, who lived in Sussex County. In this single page letter, Seward writes of his recent arrival to New York City and how the American soldiers are preparing to defend themselves against the British army. The letter bears no postal markings but was sent during period of operations of the Constitutional Post, and the absence of endorsement to named carrier and the impersonal form of address on the cover, \"these with care\" may suggest that it was conveyed in the mail. As Seward wrote this letter, the Revolutionary War was well underway. The early battles at Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill had occurred nearly a year earlier. In the spring of 1776, Congress ordered the defense of New York from British troops searching for Loyalists. George Washington and his troops were dispatched and waited for the British army. Washington's poorly equipped and under-trained troops were defeated at the Battle of Long Island (August 17, 1776) and the Battle of Washington Heights (August 29-30, 1776). Letters at this time commonly carried news for other families, such as Seward's note about John Welling. In addition, letter writers often included news about the war. Local publishers would mine the text for such information to add to their newspapers, listing these pieces as having come from a \"correspondent.\" The letter reads: March 29, 1776: Last Night arrived in New York all well But John Welling Left in Nework [sic] with a pain in the side. My Dear, I am in good health at present, hoping few Lines may find you as I am at present. Blessed be God for the same first Numbers of Soldiers if in town and great preparations making for Defence. I know Not when I shall Return home but I think Not long. First if I stay the month out I shall think the time Long my dear. But I shall Right to you again the first opportunity. My kind Love to you my dear and all my children: I can not wright if such [illegible]. So no more at present, but I remain your loving husband til death. John Seward",

    "description": "This First Sheet Comprehending the Nine Northern States, With Parts of Virginia and the Territories North of Ohio\" is the earliest known section of Abraham Bradley's map series. Abraham Bradley, Jr., a lawyer and topographer from Connecticut, was hired as a clerk in the General Post Office by Postmaster General Timothy Pickering in 1791. Bradley quickly made his name as the office’s authority on postal routes and schedules, many of which he devised himself. When Bradley published the first Map of the United States, Exhibiting the Post-Roads, the Situations, Connections, and Distances of the Post-Offices,\" it was barely fifteen years after the War of Independence had ended. Most citizens of the fledgling United States could not conceive of the magnitude of the new nation. They searched for a national culture and identity after the final and official separation from Great Britain. This colorful series of maps, on display in almost every large post office, showed the public a consolidated country with national borders. Some of Bradley's maps included detailed charts listing stagecoach schedules along the nation's principle post road. The inclusion of these schedules promoted, encouraged, and broadened popular notions of time that were otherwise confined to seasonal and religious practices. Citizens began to consider (and later demand adherence to) weekly and daily notations of time as measured by the institution of regularly-scheduled mail service.",

    "description": "Stampless cover sent from J. Yeates to General Edward Hand has no postal markings. Docketing is dated December 6, 1789, with Lancaster, Pennsylvania given as location of the writer Jasper Yeates. The single sheet folded letter has not postal markings or rate and is addressed to Edward Hand, Esquire, in Convention in Philadelphia for the state constitution that would be ratified in 1790. 1789 was a significant year in United States' history; the Constitution had been ratified, in the spring George Washington was inaugurated as the nation's first President, and the Judiciary Act of 1789 provided for a Supreme Court. The state of Pennsylvania was convening delegates in Philadelphia in 1789 to debate the state constitution. There was a great power struggle for the state government between the urban Philadelphians and the rural population. Ultimately, the \"urbans\" prevailed, and the government was revamped to be more centralized. There is another letter from Yeates to Hand dated December 14, 1789, in the collection, see object 0.260305.7.21.1.

    "title": "Letter to Colonel Edward Hand from Jasper Yeates",
    "year": 1776,
    "description": "This letter was sent to Colonel Edward Hand by Jasper Yeates during the American Revolutionary War. Writing on the front and back of a single page, Yeates shares strategical information with the Colonel, ranging from his position and future movements to financial matters. Early in the letter he mentions his upcoming journey, writing: I go tomorrow to Fort Pitt, under the Appointment of a Commission for treating with the Indians in the 25th Instant.\" Despite the business attended to in the letter, the tone remains informal and Yeates takes time to mention both his wife and that of the Colonel. Jasper Yeates was a lawyer from Pennsylvania, a strong Patriot who went on to be among the delegates who ratified the United States Constitution in 1787. Edward Hand was an Irish born medic who rose to the rank of Brigadier General during the siege of Yorktown. The two men knew each other from Lancaster, Pennsylvania where they had lived prior to the beginning of the Revolutionary War. The Revolutionary Wars saw the beginnings of the American postal system. Originally operating alongside the British Royal Mail, William Goddard’s Newspaper carrier service effectively developed into the postal service of independent America. Despite problems with fraud, staffing and high expenditure, the postal service in those early years of the new state established the foundation of the U.S. postal system.

    "year": 1808,
    "description": "{'Description (Brief)': 'The New England Primer was the first reading primer designed in the American colonies. It is considered one of the most successful textbooks of the 18th century and continued with improved editions into the 19th century. Alphabet verses teaching morality lessons concerning good and evil comprise much of the book. Many of the teachings can be found from the King James Bible as well as Puritan ideals. Secular alphabet passages came later. The New England Primer also contained a catechism with questions and answers about faith and prayers. First published by Benjamin Harris in 1686 in Boston, the book was found in many homes along with the Bible. Modeled after British primers that had been created to educate the illiterate during the Reformation, this primer was nicknamed The Little Bible of New England\" and was used in early colonial schools such as Boston Latin School. Versions varied locally with the selection of lessons, and publisher and bookseller advertisements were included in many.\\nThis is a 71 page hand bound edition published in 1808 and later reprinted in 1822 by Peter Brynberg (1755?-1816). Brynberg had a bookstore in Wilmington, Delaware. He published the Christian Repository and the Wilmington Gazette 1791-1799 with partner Samuel Andrews), and printed educational and religious books. His business was at Fourth and Shipley Streets.\\nMost primers were small to fit in a child\\'s hand; this one is 3 5/8 inches x 3 inches. Unfortunately missing its hardcover and part of the last page, which has an inscription in verse and a signature of the owner from 1822. It has black block illustrations to accompany the morality lessons and the alphabet verses.', 'Location': 'Currently not on view'}",

The Constitution allowed state legislatures to choose their own preferred method of selecting members for the Electoral College that would in turn select the president. Five state legislatures directly appointed members, while others established various systems that allowed voters to have a voice. In Maryland the voters at large, nearly eight thousand men, voted for presidential electors in 1789. Every state’s electors voted for George Washington to be president.",

    "description": "This object contains almanacs published from 1800-1833, hand-bound together in tan linen. The almanac (archaically spelled almanack) spread valuable information during a time when newspapers were scarce. Their popularity with the public and low overhead made them attractive for publishers as well. While almanacs may be known for their farmer’s calendar or weather forecasts, they also served as calendars that marked holidays and feast days, and notable historic dates. The calendar also tracked the transit of celestial bodies and included related astrological guidance. Additional materials included literary extracts, poetry, a list of roads and their mileage to major cities, medical advice, cooking recipes, patent notices, rates of interest, short histories, political discussions, schedules of courts, and practical advice. The diversity of topics made the almanac useful for every strata of society, creating an early form of mainstream culture. Almanacs were usually just bound by sewing, but the Copp’s compiled these into one bound volume, speaking to its usefulness as a resource even after the year they were published had passed.",

Affectionate Sister I am very full of business at present therefore I cannot rite you a long letter this opportunity. - however you may write me as long a one as you please in return for it—We sat sail from the point after I left my native habitation and we arrived in New York the Sunday morning following , where I found the family all well they were glad that I had got back they where very much In the in want of me to attend to the Store, &c . - - The passengers where Capt . Pendleton, Mrs. Davis & Daughter, Mrs. Tarrot &. Betsey Tarrot Mrs. Wood & Child Nancy Wilcox, myself & Capt. Fannings Negro Woman; beside Capt . Hilcox and Peleg Wilcox the whole of us made 12 all on board a little sloop although we where crowded yet we had a good time the whole of the way down to New York, The reason of our having so long a passage was that we had to stop In New Haven, for Capt. Pendleton had some business of consequence to attend to there , we arrived In New Haven harbour about sunrise on Thursday morning and about 9 oclock Capt. Pendleton went on shore, and was to be at the Coffee House at 3 oclock in the afternoon about 3 oclock Capt. Wilcox went ashore after him but no Capt. Pendleton was there after waiting some time for him Capt . Wilcox come on board again (for we were anchored out in the bay) and about sundown he went on shore after him again, but he was not there—nor had he been there; he then came back on board and staid till the tide and wind was fair, (which was about 2 oclock at Night)-·and then we sat sail and left Capt. Pendleton behind We had a delightful sale down through hellgate , I had a perfect view of all the elegant houses, & Isaar, George & Nancy Randalls, Fathers house , amongst the rest had a share of the sight of my large eyes to view it. I think it a beautiful situation it is surrounded on all sides by lofty Lombardy poplar trees, but the house is not so elegant as the situation I think . I have not seen him yet to have any conversation with him, but he soon heard of my arrival, for___ not been home 10 minutes before he came __ to our house accompanied by a Gentlem'ln: and gat the letter I had for him: for I stopd to Uncle Roberts and waited till Mr. Chesebrough wrote him one; I did not think to write so long a letter when I began; but now the time draws near that I must quit my pen, and attend to the business of the Day. I had a very good time at the Point , I had some of the Crook Neck pears that Nancy Brought home. My best Respects to everybody & Love to all the family. Write me the first opportunity, for there will be on in a week from this date. God day.",

    "description": "This is a book of Dutch Church Psalms belonged to Samuel Copp Jr., born in Stonington, Connecticut in 1787. The Copp family had a long association with the First Congressional Church in Stonington, beginning with Jonathan Copp in 1699. His son Samuel became a deacon in 1802; this book was used by Samuel’s son Samuel Jr. around 1804. The book of Dutch Church Psalms contained the Psalms of David (set to a proper meter so they could be sung in church) as well as the Catechism, Compendium, Confession of Faith, and Liturgy for the Dutch Reformed Church. The book was printed and sold by Charles R. and George Webster in Albany, New York.",

    "year": 1798,
    "description": "<i> A Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Venture, a Native of Africa: But Resident above Sixty Years in the United States of America. Related by Himself</i> was published by C. Hold at the Bee-Office in New London, Connecticut in 1798. As noted in the title, the book was “related” by Venture to his teacher, Elisha Niles, and published the same year. Venture’s was captured as a 10 or 11 year old from West Africa and sold to slavers, who sold him to Robinson Mumford, from Rhode Island. As a slave in New England, Venture married his wife Meg, also a slave, who gave birth to their daughter, Hannah. After Hannah’s birth in 1754, Venture was sold to Thomas Stanton of Stonington, Connecticut and continued to toil as a slave, ending up with Captain Oliver Smith in 1760. Five years later he was allowed to purchase his freedom for 71 pounds. Working as a free man, Venture purchased his sons in 1769and his wife, Meg, in 1772. In 1775 he purchased his daughter Hannah, reuniting his entire family. He lived in East Haddam, Connecticut until his death in 1805. While the slave narrative was becoming a popular genre at the end of the 18th century, the presence of this book in the Copp’s library is rather interesting due to a family relationship with Thomas Stanton, the “villain” in the story. Margaret Stanton, who married Samuel Copp in 1721, was Thomas Stanton’s third cousin.",

    "title": "Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Women",
    "year": 1792,
    "description": "Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797), an Englishwoman who wrote social and political commentary in the “republican” tradition of her day, produced A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1792. The pamphlet quickly became a sensation in both Europe and the US. This copy is an early American edition, published in Boston just a few months after the original appeared in London. It was popular reading among a broad public in the early nation, when citizens of the US eagerly followed international debates. The handwriting on the top of the title page suggests someone named “Lettice” may have owned this one. Wollstonecraft was one of a very few women who tried to make a living as a professional writer in the 1790s. Her first publication, on the topic of female education, drew on her experience as a private governess. Her second, A Vindication of the Rights of Man, defended the French Revolution against those who preferred hierarchy and elite control and lamentcd the new political engagement of ordinary men. Her more famous treatise, on the Rights of Woman, responded to a French Revolutionary proposal that would have the government fund schools for French boys but leave girls to learn domestic skills at home. Wollstonecraft defended females’ capacity for rational thought and denounced social mores that rendered women frivolous and passive. Her work did not claim social equality or political rights, such as voting, for women, but it insisted that educated women could contribute to the sum of the world’s knowledge both as mothers within families and as participants in their broader society. Widely discussed and debated, Wollstonecraft’s work was received well even by some who disagreed with her radical ideas. Late in the 1790s, however, information about her unconventional personal life discredited her ideas among some. In the early 1800s, a growing backlash against women’s revolutionary gains made Wollstonecraft denounced more often than read. Still, her ideas galvanized supporters of improving women’s education; informed abolitionist women who pressed to speak in public in the 1830s; and, inspired participants in the formal women’s rights movement of the 1840s and beyond. Twentieth- and twenty-first century women also rediscovered her pathbreaking ideas.",

    "description": "One page handwritten invoice from Ebenezer Hancock to Joseph Robbins for household goods, previously folded into quarters. Currently in mitered veneer frame with brass hanging ring at top center, glazed. Reads: Bought of Eben\\r Hancock\" by Joseph Robbins, Boston, October 25, 1774, includes household goods (2 \"brass Kittle[s]\", \"1 Warming Pan\", \"1 doz. Plates\", \"3 3 pint Basons\" \"12 quart [Basons]\" and \"4 doz. Knives & Forks\"), hardware (\"½ doz. H Hinges\", \"½ doz. HL [Hinges]\", 8 Thumb Latches\", Brads\", nails and \"½ Faggott English Steel\") and tools (\"1 Handsaw\"), totaling £9.13.18[?]. Ebenezer Hancock (1741-1819) was the younger brother of John Hancock (1737-1793), president of the Second Continental Congress, governor of Massachusetts, and signer of the Declaration of Independence. Aided by a sizeable inheritance from his uncle Thomas Hancock (1703-1764), Ebenezer opened his first retail hardware shop in 1764 in partnership with Edward Blanchard, but the business failed by 1768. With John's help, however, Ebenezer established another shop and was able to secure the position of Deputy Paymaster General for the Eastern Department of the Continental Army during the American Revolution. He inherited a third of John's estate in 1793, including the Beacon Hill mansion known as Hancock House. The Hancock Family Papers, Mss:766 1712-1854 H234, at Baker Library Special Collections, Harvard Business School, Harvard University, includes Series III. Ebenezer Hancock papers, 1739-1831 (bulk 1757-1815); Box 17, Folder 19, contains accounts of interest and accounts of sales of goods to Ebenezer Hancock including hardware and shoes, dated 1768-1783.",

    "year": 1794,
    "description": "This 1794 British Admiralty document authorized Capt. John Thomas Duckworth of HMS <I>Orion</I> to impress as many seamen (or rivermen) as necessary to adequately man his vessel or “any other of His Majesty’s Ships.” Each man recruited this way was to receive one shilling as “Prest Money.” The document that conveyed this extraordinary power expired a little more than a year after issue. Around the same time as this press warrant, the British Admiralty published a pamphlet outlining in considerable detail the conditions under which seaman or landsmen could be impressed into the Royal Navy. Certain categories of men were excluded, such as fishermen, whalemen, ship masters, mates or carpenters, youths under 18 or men over 55 years of age, foreigners and others. Before impressment, a call for volunteers was made, together with an offer of two months wages as an enticement. For the safety of the pressed ship and cargo, men impressed from British vessels had to be replaced through the end of the voyage to the point of cargo unloading, so that their ships were not dangerously shorthanded. After that point, the replacements had to be paid conduct money so they might return to their proper ship. In the early 19th century, impressment of American seamen into the Royal Navy was commonplace, as Britain required large umbers of crewmen to man its active Navy. By the War of 1812, the rules regarding foreigners must have been revised, or at least very sharply bent, for excessive impressment of Americans was one of the main reasons that the United States entered the War of 1812.",

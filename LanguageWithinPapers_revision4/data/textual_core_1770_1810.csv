Written from Coopers Ferry, Gloucester County, New Jersey, on 28 January 1808, this is \""a copy of a letter sent to General Post Office, Washington City.\"" Signed \""R. M. C.,\"" likely Robert M. Cooper who replaced Postmaster Charles Cooper (1806-1810) at Cooper's Ferry in 1810.

The mail carrier informs me that there is scarcely a letter mailed there or one left for delivery but little as it is, it was the duty of the P.M. to have forwarded his accounts, etc. Joseph Sharp Esq. is the post master at that office but the business is done by a Deputy.\nWilliam Erwin is the post master at Weymouth Post Office which is on the route, a person fully competent for the office and I apprehend has forwarded his accounts before this will reach Washington.\nJohn Donalds of Longacoming I heard was appointed P.Master at that place some time since, but I have understood he declines accepting the appointment and the letter directed for Look-a-coming[?] are taken out of the mail at the post office at Haddorfield; of course it is considered that there is no post office at Lonacoming[?].\nI cannot account for the reason that Joseph Reynolds P.M. at Haddorfield[?] has not forwarded his account for I believe he is at home and in health.\nThere is I apprehend some misconception in regard to the information obtained respecting there being no return receive[?] at Washington from the Post Office at Coopers Ferry [begin page 2] at the date of my letter. The accounts current and account of mails received at and sent from that office were forwarded by mail the 5th Inst for the quarter ending 31st ultimo and at the same time a request was made for a supply of Blank Way Bill and other Blank, which have in consequence been received from Washington at the Post Office at Coopers Ferry some days before the receipt of thy favour, so that there can be no doubt of the receipt of the account, etc. from this place at Washington some time before the 14th Inst. the date of thy letter and there is receipts now in the office for every quarter preceding the last, since the establishment of the office at this place. In respect to information with regard to the route of the mail from this place to the Egghorbour Townships I apprehend it will not shortly be a profitable one for the United States, as the daily and almost hourly private conveyances which offer from Philadelphia to those townships and which affords so many opportunities to convey letters without charge, and the scattered situation of the inhabitants, all combine to make private conveyance of letters more common than by mail.\nThe Stage Driver who is the mail carrier, although he has the hundred dollar more for carrying the mail, to those townships than is paid for carrying the Tuckulos[?] mail, which is about the same distance from this place, informed me he finds it but a poor business on account of the frequent intercourse by private waggons, which carry packages at a fare very much under his price [begin page 3] which deprives him very considerably of one of the [?] of making it worth his while to continue the business after the expiration of his contract. I think this will continue to be the case while the inhabitants of that quarter follow their present pursuits of taking fish, [?], etc. for the Philadelphia market which continually keeps their wagon passing and repassing on the same route as the mail. Nevertheless as there is a port of entry at Townes[?] Point in Egghorbour Township, it will perhaps be to the interest of the United States to continue the route, more especially in case of a rupture with any naval power what ever, as it is in the recollection of many persons, that during the last war, Eggharbour was the way by which considerable quantities of merchandize were brought to Philadelphia by land, which no doubt will be the case again if a war should take place at a future period.\nI am respectfully\nThy Friend\nR. M. C[?]\nP. S. Since closing the above I have seen J.

On three occasions between 1789 and 1792, Congress passed temporary measures to maintain the postal system. During that time, Congress debated the regulation of the system established by Article 1, section 8 of the federal Constitution, which states: \""The Congress shall have the Power . . . To Establish Post Offices and post Roads.\""\nAmong the issues that Congress debated were rate structure, privacy, and procedures for the establishment of new postal routes. The Post Office Act of 1792 codified the presumption that Congress would retain primary control over postal policy--a presumption that remained a cornerstone of that policy until the service was restructured under the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970. In particular, the Post Office Act of 1792 admitted newspapers into the mail at extremely low rates, facilitating the spread of information essential to the creation of an informed citizenry. The Act also forbade the opening of letters as a tool of surveillance. In addition, it established the principle that new post routes would be designated by Congress--rather than the executive - forestalling the possibility that narrow financial considerations might constrain the network's expansion.\nReference:\nFuller, Wayne.

Goddard experienced the abuse of authority by the British firsthand in Philadelphia after he formed a partnership with Benjamin Franklin to publish the Pennsylvania Chronicle, a paper sympathetic to the revolutionary cause. The local postmaster failed to deliver out-of-town newspapers to Goddard, depriving him of a critical source of information. The Chronicle was subsequently driven out of business when the Crown post refused to accept it in the mails. Goddard retaliated by designing a distinctly American postal system to challenge the Crown's post office. He founded the proposal on the principles of open communication, freedom from governmental interference, and the guaranteed free exchange of ideas.\nGoddard presented his plan to the Continental Congress on October 5, 1774, nearly two years before the formal declaration of independence from England. Congress tabled Goddard's plan until after the battles of Lexington and Concord in the spring of 1775. On July 26, 1775, the plan, known as the 'Constitutional Post', was adopted and implemented, ensuring communication between patriots and keeping the general populace informed of events during the American Revolution. Goddard\u2019s system provided a link between members of the Committees of Correspondence, Committees of Safety, and the Sons of Liberty.\nGoddard also achieved a measure of personal revenge as the revolutionary post forced the Crown's post office out of business in America on Christmas Day 1775.

The ledger also documents the successful lobbying of Secretary of Comptroller John Parker for an increase in his annual allowance.\nWhen the methodically-minded Benjamin Franklin became joint deputy postmaster general in North America, he promptly instituted a new system of accounts, including one that enabled the General Post Office to standardize local postmasters' accounting methods. The new manner of bookkeeping did not abolish the opportunity for the dishonest to profit but it did prove beneficial since the comptroller could now check a new postmaster's accounts against the old for losses.""}",https://collections.si.edu/search/detail/edanmdm:npm_1982.0786.1,"{""Type"": ""Archival Material""}"

In this single page letter, Seward writes of his recent arrival to New York City and how the American soldiers are preparing to defend themselves against the British army. The letter bears no postal markings but was sent during period of operations of the Constitutional Post, and the absence of endorsement to named carrier and the impersonal form of address on the cover, \""these with care\"" may suggest that it was conveyed in the mail.\nAs Seward wrote this letter, the Revolutionary War was well underway. The early battles at Lexington, Concord, and Bunker Hill had occurred nearly a year earlier. In the spring of 1776, Congress ordered the defense of New York from British troops searching for Loyalists. George Washington and his troops were dispatched and waited for the British army. Washington's poorly equipped and under-trained troops were defeated at the Battle of Long Island (August 17, 1776) and the Battle of Washington Heights (August 29-30, 1776).\nLetters at this time commonly carried news for other families, such as Seward's note about John Welling. In addition, letter writers often included news about the war. Local publishers would mine the text for such information to add to their newspapers, listing these pieces as having come from a \""correspondent.\""\nThe letter reads:\nMarch 29, 1776: Last Night arrived in New York all well But John Welling Left in Nework [sic] with a pain in the side.

Most citizens of the fledgling United States could not conceive of the magnitude of the new nation.

This colorful series of maps, on display in almost every large post office, showed the public a consolidated country with national borders.\nSome of Bradley's maps included detailed charts listing stagecoach schedules along the nation's principle post road. The inclusion of these schedules promoted, encouraged, and broadened popular notions of time that were otherwise confined to seasonal and religious practices.

Edward Hand was an Irish born medic who rose to the rank of Brigadier General during the siege of Yorktown. The two men knew each other from Lancaster, Pennsylvania where they had lived prior to the beginning of the Revolutionary War.\nThe Revolutionary Wars saw the beginnings of the American postal system. Originally operating alongside the British Royal Mail, William Goddard\u2019s Newspaper carrier service effectively developed into the postal service of independent America.

"The New-England Primer Improved, 1922","{""date made"": ""1808"", ""associated date"": ""1808""}","{""printer"": ""Brynberg, Peter""}","{""general subject association"": ""Education""}",,"{""Description (Brief)"": ""The New England Primer was the first reading primer designed in the American colonies. It is considered one of the most successful textbooks of the 18th century and continued with improved editions into the 19th century. Alphabet verses teaching morality lessons concerning good and evil comprise much of the book. Many of the teachings can be found from the King James Bible as well as Puritan ideals. Secular alphabet passages came later. The New England Primer also contained a catechism with questions and answers about faith and prayers. First published by Benjamin Harris in 1686 in Boston, the book was found in many homes along with the Bible. Modeled after British primers that had been created to educate the illiterate during the Reformation, this primer was nicknamed \""The Little Bible of New England\"" and was used in early colonial schools such as Boston Latin School. Versions varied locally with the selection of lessons, and publisher and bookseller advertisements were included in many.\nThis is a 71 page hand bound edition published in 1808 and later reprinted in 1822 by Peter Brynberg (1755?-1816). Brynberg had a bookstore in Wilmington, Delaware. He published the Christian Repository and the Wilmington Gazette 1791-1799 with partner Samuel Andrews), and printed educational and religious books. His business was at Fourth and Shipley Streets.\nMost primers were small to fit in a child's hand; this one is 3 5/8 inches x 3 inches. Unfortunately missing its hardcover and part of the last page, which has an inscription in verse and a signature of the owner from 1822. It has black block illustrations to accompany the morality lessons and the alphabet verses."", ""Location"": ""Currently not on view""}",https://collections.si.edu/search/detail/edanmdm:nmah_663068,"{""Object Name"": ""Book""}"

Home bound almanacs,"{""date made"": ""1800-1833""}",,,"https://ids.si.edu/ids/iiif/NMAH-AHB2014q066731/full/250,/0/default.jpg","{""Description"": ""This object contains almanacs published from 1800-1833, hand-bound together in tan linen. The almanac (archaically spelled almanack) spread valuable information during a time when newspapers were scarce. Their popularity with the public and low overhead made them attractive for publishers as well. While almanacs may be known for their farmer\u2019s calendar or weather forecasts, they also served as calendars that marked holidays and feast days, and notable historic dates. The calendar also tracked the transit of celestial bodies and included related astrological guidance. Additional materials included literary extracts, poetry, a list of roads and their mileage to major cities, medical advice, cooking recipes, patent notices, rates of interest, short histories, political discussions, schedules of courts, and practical advice. The diversity of topics made the almanac useful for every strata of society, creating an early form of mainstream culture. Almanacs were usually just bound by sewing, but the Copp\u2019s compiled these into one bound volume, speaking to its usefulness as a resource even after the year they were published had passed.\nThe Copp Collection contains about 150 books of early American imprint and shows a wide range of reading matter typical of a New England Puritan family living in a port town. Literacy was expected of many New Englanders, as Puritan doctrine required everyone to read the Bible. The abundance of multiple Bibles, psalms, hymnodies, sermons, and morality tales reflects the Copp\u2019s religious beliefs. Other highlights of the library include the works of Shakespeare, almanacs, historical and political texts, and travel narratives.\nThe Copp Collection contains a variety of household objects that the Copp family of Connecticut used from around 1700 until the mid-1800s.

The book of Dutch Church Psalms contained the Psalms of David (set to a proper meter so they could be sung in church) as well as the Catechism, Compendium, Confession of Faith, and Liturgy for the Dutch Reformed Church.

"A Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Venture, a Native of Africa","{""date made"": ""1798""}",,"{""Subject"": ""Slavery""}","https://ids.si.edu/ids/iiif/NMAH-AHB2014q069459/full/250,/0/default.jpg","{""Description"": ""<i> A Narrative of the Life and Adventures of Venture, a Native of Africa: But Resident above Sixty Years in the United States of America. Related by Himself</i> was published by C. Hold at the Bee-Office in New London, Connecticut in 1798. As noted in the title, the book was \u201crelated\u201d by Venture to his teacher, Elisha Niles, and published the same year. Venture\u2019s was captured as a 10 or 11 year old from West Africa and sold to slavers, who sold him to Robinson Mumford, from Rhode Island. As a slave in New England, Venture married his wife Meg, also a slave, who gave birth to their daughter, Hannah. After Hannah\u2019s birth in 1754, Venture was sold to Thomas Stanton of Stonington, Connecticut and continued to toil as a slave, ending up with Captain Oliver Smith in 1760. Five years later he was allowed to purchase his freedom for 71 pounds. Working as a free man, Venture purchased his sons in 1769and his wife, Meg, in 1772. In 1775 he purchased his daughter Hannah, reuniting his entire family. He lived in East Haddam, Connecticut until his death in 1805.\nWhile the slave narrative was becoming a popular genre at the end of the 18th century, the presence of this book in the Copp\u2019s library is rather interesting due to a family relationship with Thomas Stanton, the \u201cvillain\u201d in the story. Margaret Stanton, who married Samuel Copp in 1721, was Thomas Stanton\u2019s third cousin.\nThe Copp Collection contains about 150 books of early American imprint and shows a wide range of reading matter typical of a New England Puritan family living in a port town. Literacy was expected of many New Englanders, as Puritan doctrine required everyone to read the Bible. The abundance of multiple Bibles, psalms, hymnodies, sermons, and morality tales reflects the Copp\u2019s religious beliefs. Other highlights of the library include the works of Shakespeare, almanacs, historical and political texts, and travel narratives.\nThe Copp Collection contains a variety of household objects that the Copp family of Connecticut used from around 1700 until the mid-1800s. Part of the Puritan Great Migration from England to Boston, the family eventually made their home in New London County, Connecticut, where their textiles, clothes, utensils, ceramics, books, bibles, and letters provide a vivid picture of daily life.

Wollstonecraft’s Vindication of the Rights of Women,"{""date made"": ""1792""}",,"{""general subject association"": ""Women's History\nBooks"", ""general subject association; classified"": ""Women's Rights""}",,"{""Description"": ""Mary Wollstonecraft (1759-1797), an Englishwoman who wrote social and political commentary in the \u201crepublican\u201d tradition of her day, produced A Vindication of the Rights of Woman in 1792. The pamphlet quickly became a sensation in both Europe and the US. This copy is an early American edition, published in Boston just a few months after the original appeared in London. It was popular reading among a broad public in the early nation, when citizens of the US eagerly followed international debates. The handwriting on the top of the title page suggests someone named \u201cLettice\u201d may have owned this one.\nWollstonecraft was one of a very few women who tried to make a living as a professional writer in the 1790s. Her first publication, on the topic of female education, drew on her experience as a private governess. Her second, A Vindication of the Rights of Man, defended the French Revolution against those who preferred hierarchy and elite control and lamentcd the new political engagement of ordinary men. Her more famous treatise, on the Rights of Woman, responded to a French Revolutionary proposal that would have the government fund schools for French boys but leave girls to learn domestic skills at home. Wollstonecraft defended females\u2019 capacity for rational thought and denounced social mores that rendered women frivolous and passive. Her work did not claim social equality or political rights, such as voting, for women, but it insisted that educated women could contribute to the sum of the world\u2019s knowledge both as mothers within families and as participants in their broader society.\nWidely discussed and debated, Wollstonecraft\u2019s work was received well even by some who disagreed with her radical ideas. Late in the 1790s, however, information about her unconventional personal life discredited her ideas among some. In the early 1800s, a growing backlash against women\u2019s revolutionary gains made Wollstonecraft denounced more often than read. Still, her ideas galvanized supporters of improving women\u2019s education; informed abolitionist women who pressed to speak in public in the 1830s; and, inspired participants in the formal women\u2019s rights movement of the 1840s and beyond. Twentieth- and twenty-first century women also rediscovered her pathbreaking ideas.""}",https://collections.si.edu/search/detail/edanmdm:nmah_1835346,"{""Object Name"": ""book""}"

Part of the Puritan Great Migration from England to Boston, the family eventually made their home in New London County, Connecticut, where their textiles, clothes, utensils, ceramics, books, bibles, and letters provide a vivid picture of daily life.

John Thomas Duckworth of HMS <I>Orion</I> to impress as many seamen (or rivermen) as necessary to adequately man his vessel or \u201cany other of His Majesty\u2019s Ships.\u201d Each man recruited this way was to receive one shilling as \u201cPrest Money.\u201d The document that conveyed this extraordinary power expired a little more than a year after issue.\nAround the same time as this press warrant, the British Admiralty published a pamphlet outlining in considerable detail the conditions under which seaman or landsmen could be impressed into the Royal Navy. Certain categories of men were excluded, such as fishermen, whalemen, ship masters, mates or carpenters, youths under 18 or men over 55 years of age, foreigners and others.\nBefore impressment, a call for volunteers was made, together with an offer of two months wages as an enticement. For the safety of the pressed ship and cargo, men impressed from British vessels had to be replaced through the end of the voyage to the point of cargo unloading, so that their ships were not dangerously shorthanded. After that point, the replacements had to be paid conduct money so they might return to their proper ship.\nIn the early 19th century, impressment of American seamen into the Royal Navy was commonplace, as Britain required large umbers of crewmen to man its active Navy. By the War of 1812, the rules regarding foreigners must have been revised, or at least very sharply bent, for excessive impressment of Americans was one of the main reasons that the United States entered the War of 1812.""}",https://collections.si.edu/search/detail/edanmdm:nmah_1343167,"{""Object Name"": ""TR*335662\ndocument""}"

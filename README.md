## 📖 About

Paper Trail visualizes **466 documents** from the American Revolutionary period, revealing how language circulated across different contexts. Each document is classified by topic—**Military**, **Society**, **Political**, **Religion**, and **Business**—creating a mosaic that traces linguistic patterns and connections.

Rather than showing how words changed over time, this project illuminates the **interconnected networks of revolutionary language** across letters, pamphlets, broadsides, and official documents.

### Features

- **Interactive mosaic visualization** with 466 historical documents
- **Topic-based filtering** across five categories
- **Time period filtering** by decade (1770–1810)
- **Document detail view** with high-resolution images and metadata
- **Multi-page document support** with thumbnail navigation
- **Keyword highlighting** based on topic classification
- **Responsive design** for desktop and mobile

## 🎨 Visual Design

Each tile represents a document:
- **Color** indicates the dominant topic
- **Position** follows chronological order (1770–1810)
- **Hover** reveals document preview and metadata
- **Click** opens full detail view with images and description

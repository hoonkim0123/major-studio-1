Revolutionary-era documents visualization project using data from the Smithsonian Institution.

## Description

This project visualizes how words circulated across different contexts during the American Revolutionary era rather than how they changed over time. By classifying each document by topic—**Military**, **Society**, **Political**, **Religion**, and **Business**—and analyzing keyword frequencies, the visualization reveals linguistic networks and patterns in revolutionary documents.

The interactive interface allows users to filter and explore recurring terms, uncovering the interconnected language that shaped one of history's most transformative periods.
